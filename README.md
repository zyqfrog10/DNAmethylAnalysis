# DNA methylation Analysis
This project is part of the DNA methylation pipeline developed at Center of Epigenetics Research (CER), MSKCC.

It will process bismark output, perform exploratory analyses, and conduct differential methylation. Diagnositc plots and a bsseq object will be generated from the exploratory analyses in "explore" mode. Differential DMCs and DMRs will be identified using 'DSS' and annotated with 'annotatr'. The resulted tables can be used for further downstream analyses.
